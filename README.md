This project was made for the course EECS3216 at York University. Here we implemented a BLDC motor driver using the SVPWM algorithm implemented in verilog, and intended for the DE10-Lite.
We implemented our own circuit driver for a BLDC motor, in which we used the DE10-Lite FPGA to control the motor.

This repository contains a runnable project that can be compiled within the Quartus Prime editor.
